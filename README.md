# POS-System-Practice-Project-
This file is the first system I made and it is a practice project.

The system is a Point of Sale system.
How to use:
An admin account (name: admin || password: 123) is initialized once the program is running, login using admin account and create an employee account inside the admin viewboard, you can change role whether the account you just created to an admin account, you can also delete account inside the admin viewboard.
In the employee viewboard, you will log in using your created employee account in the employee log in area, once in you can choose to click shop viewboard if you want to go to the shop (which will be empty if you haven't added some product) and manage product if you want to manage product (add or delete), inside this you can set the price of the product and add it, you can also remove product here, then if you're done setting up your shop you can go to "shop viewboard" which will show you the list of your products and its price, then you can now use it as a POS system, a simple one.
